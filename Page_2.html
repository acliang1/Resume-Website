            <h2>Description of LuxBar</h2>
            <p>
                Luxbar is a Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood bar and restaurant. I started working at luxbar as a busser since October, 2020. <br>
                As a busser, I help provide customer service by providing water, plates, and silverware when new customers come into the restaurant. Once the customers leaves, we would clean out all the dirty dishes from the tables and bring it down for the dishwashers. We also make sure the tables are clean using disinfection wipe to have customers satisfaction.
                Busser is mostly the one doing the most of the manual labor within the staff. As we make sure trash are being thrown out, make sure inventory are in check for customer service. 
                <br>
                As a worker at LuxBar, we focus as a group in teamwork. Although, each one of us have different roles and responsibility to fufill, we make sure to help each other out. When rush hour hits, as a team we help each other, provide communication, and support each other.
